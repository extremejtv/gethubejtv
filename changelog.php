- Fixed mouseover text to show what buttons are for on the icon() function for emotes.  Buttons with mouse over (B, I, U, S, and picture to chat button).  I also added spaces for better formatting.
<br />
<br />
- There is a bug with the [img][/img] tags when posting a picture to chat.  For some reason the script won't allow underscores so if you are un able to view a picture with an underscore, (filename_blah_123.jpg) try another picture without the "_" underscore in the link/filename.
<br />
<br />
- Added mouseover text on pictures posted to chat so people know they can click to zoom picture.
